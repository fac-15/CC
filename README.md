## Team Colour Code one page website

### Welcome to the Colour Code code base!

#### Best lesson learned...:

- We had forgotten to check out to a new branch...
- We wrote an entire function directly into our local master branch...
- We then checked out the master branch and completely overwrote all our work...
- **Always checkout a new branch before you make any changes to your project**

#### Issues we faced during this project:

- Remembering to checkout a new branch before beginning work...
- Remembering the correct order of all the MANY git commands...
- Remember to save before you stage and commit or the changes won't be there...
- When to use what command...
- git merge master and what to do next...
