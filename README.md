### Welcome to the Colour Code code base!

#### Lessons learned...:

- We had forgotten to check out to a new branch...
- We wrote an entire function directly into our local master branch...
- We then checked out the master branch and completely overwrote all our work...
- **Always checkout a new branch before you make any changes to your project**

#### Issues we faced during this project:

- Remembering to checkout a new branch before beginning work...
- Remembering the correct order of all the MANY git commands...
- Remember to save before you stage and commit or the changes won't be there...
- When to use what command...
- git merge master and what to do next...

**Accessibility**

**Errors**
- Mobile size
1. Title overlaps on navbar <br />![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36998110/47917714-3fb9a780-dea2-11e8-8998-c06bea209fbd.png)


2. Image should be shrunk 
3. Text should be wrapping around images
    
**Stretch course**
1. Search function on navbar
2. Display correct section more clearly when the profile pictures/navbar clicked

**Things to bear in mind more in the future:**
- Contrast of foreground (text) and background (gradient) colours could be srutinsed a bit better.  
This may get tricky when the background is a gradient and not a solid colour. [Webaim contrast checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker)
- Always add reset css first, **before** main css. This broke styling when someone separated the two.
